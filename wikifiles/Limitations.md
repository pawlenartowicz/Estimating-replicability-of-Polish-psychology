## Selection of scientists
Data on scientist is downloaded from official database called [radon](https://radon.nauka.gov.pl/dane/nauczyciele-akademiccy-badacze-i-osoby-zaangazowane-w-dzialalnosc-naukowa).
Registration in that database is obligatory for all active scientists who work at entities regulated by Polish higher education law. This contains mostly both public and private tertiary education units, and [Polish Academy of Science](https://pan.pl). 
It needs to be pointed out that for future analysis we consider only scientists who declared their main job at those entities which are evaluated within Polish tertiary education, that means, in units that have at least 12 employed researchers. In our database there are 1202 researchers considered that way, compared to 317 who work at smaller units and 132 who didn't declare the main job at any of the units.
Potential omissions that we are aware are about those scientists who: 
* are PhD candidates;
* are unaffiliated or affiliated outside the educational system;
* are no longer working in Poland at the time of data download (November 2022) and have exercised their right to be forgotten;
* didn't declare psychology as their discipline (it could happen because every scientist could declare up to two disciplines).
