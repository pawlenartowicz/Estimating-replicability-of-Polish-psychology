**Brief description:**

In the first instance, we are focusing on creating a comprehensive dataset of all research published by psychologists working at Polish universities. This is a crucial part of the project because having a complete set of published research allows for generalizable knowledge that is not affected by selection bias, such as focusing only on research in a narrow set of the most recognizable journals. Importantly, the period from which we are collecting articles is 2017-2021, which aligns with the evaluation timespan of institutes and the implementation of new evaluation rules, which could impact researchers' publication strategies. This provides the opportunity to study how changes in institutional settings impact science.

In the next step, we are estimating publication bias in experiments using the Z-curve method (Bartoš & Schimmack, 2022), which also offers insight into the replicability of these researches. This approach facilitates exploratory research, and we have preregistered a study to examine the potential relationship between the pressure to publish and publication bias.
