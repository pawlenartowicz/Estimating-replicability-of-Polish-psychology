**Brief description:**

In the first instance, we are focusing on creating full dataset of all published researches made by psychologist working on Polish universities. It's crucial part of this project, because such complete set of published research allows generalizable knowledge not affected by selection bias (like focusing only on research in narrow set of most recognizable journals).
What is also important, period from which we collect articles is 2017-2021 which corresponds with evaluation time scope of evaluation of institutes, and time of implementation of the new evaluation rules, what could impact researchers' publication strategy. This gives possibility to study how such change in institutional setting impact on science. 

In the next step, we are estimating publication bias in experimental using Z-curve (Bartoš & Schimmack 2022), what also give us insight into replicability of these researches. This provides an opportunity for exploratory research, also, we preregistered study of potential relation between pressure to publish and publication bias.
